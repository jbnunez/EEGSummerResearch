# EEGSummerResearch
Classifiers for EEG signals for hand motions

The main deliverables are in the eeg_generator_augmented.py file and the eeg_lstm_augmented.ipynb notebook.
These files are used (in conjunction with the pickle and .npy files) to train the lstm networks augmented by 
the covariance matrix-based distances from event cluster centers.

All of this code was generated in a research capacity where I was the sole individual working on the project, so it is poorly documented. Apologies.
